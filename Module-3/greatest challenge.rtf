\f0\fs24 \cf0 I would say the hardest thing to do will be putting in the time. I really enjoy coding but it can become very troublesome when it gets hard. It is very hard to keep going for long periods of time. But thats why I wanted to join this program because with a community i know I can get motivated by seeing my peers tackling the same challenge as I. Also giving myself enough time before the deadline to make sure I get all of my code together. }
